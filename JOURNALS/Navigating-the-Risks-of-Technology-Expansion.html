        <h1>Navigating the Risks of Technology Expansion</h1>

        <h2>The Need for Knowledge and Vigilance in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the aggressive expansion of devices and applications represents a significant emerging risk. This trend brings with it a plethora of challenges, chief among them being the fading age of accountability and the rise of AI malware as a formidable threat to cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>The Vanishing Age of Accountability</h2>
        <div class="interactive-example">
            <h3>Challenges of Modern Technology</h3>
            <button class="accordion">Rushed to Market</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We live in an era where products and services are often rushed to market, with real-time users unwittingly serving as control groups. This leads to potential zero-day events and consequential threats.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Lack of Thorough Testing</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Every new technology, update, and application heralds the potential for zero-day events and consequential threats. This trend highlights a departure from a time when accountability and thorough testing were the norms.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>AI Malware: The Foremost Cybersecurity Threat</h2>
        <div class="interactive-example">
            <h3>Understanding AI Malware</h3>
            <button class="accordion">Mimicking Human Behavior</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>AI malware can mimic and manipulate human-like social engineering attacks, making it particularly dangerous.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Compromising Networks</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The mere presence of AI malware in a system can compromise the entire network, posing a significant threat.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Expanding Attack Surface</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>With devices and applications proliferating at an unprecedented rate, the attack surface is spreading thinner, becoming more vulnerable to sophisticated threats.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>My Role in This Expanding Technological Universe</h2>
        <p>As a cybersecurity professional, my ability to respond to these threats is intrinsically linked to the progression of technology. Like a defender waiting to assess risks and vulnerabilities in new products, I must remain patient and observant, identifying weaknesses and opportunities. The effectiveness of my response will largely depend on how my peers and I leverage our skills in this expanding technological domain.</p>

        <h2>A Proactive Response: Education and Machine Learning</h2>
        <div class="interactive-example">
            <h3>Counteracting the Risks</h3>
            <button class="accordion">Integrating Machine Learning</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Integrating machine learning into education and everyday life could be a game-changer. By educating people about the activity of device networks, we can create a stronger perimeter defense.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Educating Everyday Users</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Turning everyday users into knowledgeable defenders can significantly bolster our defenses against cyber threats.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Interactive Quiz: Cybersecurity Threats and Responses</h2>
        <div class="quiz">
            <h3>Which approach involves educating people about device networks to create a stronger perimeter defense?</h3>
            <input type="radio" id="q1a1" name="q1" value="1">
            <label for="q1a1">A. Mimicking Human Behavior</label><br>
            <input type="radio" id="q1a2" name="q1" value="2">
            <label for="q1a2">B. Integrating Machine Learning</label><br>
            <input type="radio" id="q1a3" name="q1" value="3">
            <label for="q1a3">C. Expanding Attack Surface</label><br>
            <input type="radio" id="q1a4" name="q1" value="4">
            <label for="q1a4">D. Compromising Networks</label><br>
            <button onclick="checkAnswer()">Submit</button>
            <p id="result"></p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Power of Knowledge and Collective Vigilance</h2>
        <p>It's crucial to remember that while many threats exist, a significant number are figments of our imagination. The real power in cybersecurity lies in collective knowledge and vigilance. By spreading awareness and understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities inherent in our digital world, we can create a community of informed users. This community can act as the first line of defense, mitigating risks before they escalate into full-blown threats.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Embracing the Challenge with Knowledge</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the rapidly expanding universe of technology brings with it significant challenges, but also opportunities for growth and learning. By embracing machine learning and integrating cybersecurity education into our daily lives, we can build a more secure digital world. It's a collective effort, one that requires the participation and vigilance of everyone involved in the technological ecosystem. As we move forward, our strongest defense will be our knowledge and our ability to adapt to and anticipate the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.</p>
