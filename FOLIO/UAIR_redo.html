            <h2>Design and Legal Activism: A Journey of Advocacy and Art</h2>
            <p>
                As I traveled the land in search of answers to my own challenges, I came to a profound realization: the world extends far beyond my personal struggles. Yet, amid this political division that shadows my American legacy, I also recognized that no one else could secure my place in this landscape. Fueled by this understanding, I sought to stand up and advocate for something meaningful, guided by my interpretation of the Civil Rights Act. Through meticulous research and theoretical translation of American legal codes, I embarked on a journey to blend design and legal activism. This endeavor aims to transform the deeds, actions, and bonds of a people into powerful tools of judicial recall, underscoring the essential civil rights that must be upheld for all. This article chronicles my path, weaving together advocacy and art into a compelling portfolio piece. ☰

                <h1>The UAIR Symbol</h1>
                <p>
                    This image is the UAIR symbol of state independence. It inherits
                    its design from the Quran Sura 12 Ayat 4. Sura 12 is titled; Joseph and
                    details a story of prophet Joseph’s vision of 11 stars and the sun and the
                    moon prostrating themselves to him.
                <p>
                     
                <p>
                    The stars in Joseph’s vision represent his 11 brothers. In the story
                    his brothers seem to have various attitudes and yet they conspire against
                    him in a most atrocious way. Yet one of them at least suggests not to kill
                    him. regardless of what nafs he was guilty of he still carried enough good
                    sense to suggest the saving of his brothers life and even more he suggests
                    the hope that he may be picked up and carried far from them. And further
                    the brothers were presented to Joseph who enjoyed a most satisfying
                    prank upon them and to display the reward of his positioning as a keeper
                    of the stores. And further he fed his family and returned happiness to his
                    fathers heart completing a most beautiful destiny of so many of Allah’s
                    chosen people and the completion of Prophet Josephs vision. They were
                    all chosen people because the story was shared with us masha-Allah and I
                    would like to further point out that, that is also the good in the movement
                    of media. Potentially this is an important factor in the age old struggle
                    of media in Islam and an important argument that may be posed by the
                    vicegerency in the order of affairs to come.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    The sun in Joseph’s vision represents his father Jacob, and Allah
                    completing his favor upon him in the rising of his son, after bearing
                    the loss of the same with true Muslim value of faith, perseverance and
                    gratitude to Allah for the seen and unseen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The moon in Joseph’s vision represents his mother
                    The stars in the UNS vision represent the generations of mankind
                    that are the continued children of Abraham and brothers in all that the
                    light is and touches. It is further in respect of the love and even in the hate that revolved around the sibling relationship of prophet Joseph and how
                    Allah is the master of all lesson’s learned, rewards gained and rewards
                    lost. With this in mind I believe it is suitable to state it is better for us in Islam, if we but knew, to let by-gone be by-gone and continue to tend the work of the vicegerency, to the good of all men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the UNS vision the sun represents the father of the families
                    that claim their sovereignty in The One and Only Allah and categorize
                    themselves as a Muslim nation, ordered not by tradition of similarities or
                    differences, but by individual commitment to the Umma of mankind as
                    brother nations in Islam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sun is rising over the darkness because of the inevitable return
                    of Islamic influence over the family inheritance and the deliberate strategy
                    of the non-believers and polytheists to remove the father from the process
                    of the household in order to usurp the purpose of the family vicegerency
                    as secular and state government ordained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The moon and stars in darkness show how the children and the
                    women are consumed in the darkness of the dominant space of western
                    atheistic and polytheistic society. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The suns light reflecting on the moon in the darkness represents
                    the rising of the Muslim vicegerent as Oneness and the Muslim male
                    returning to his rightful place as overseer and advisor, illuminating the
                    shape and beauty of the Muslim woman’s fellowship. Thus staging an
                    appropriate balance of family values for the light of the future umma.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus are the stars different colors signifying our will and our
                    intention to restore the brotherhood of man without racial bias and
                    according to the spirit of Allah’s Vicegerency as demonstrated by the
                    caliphs of old as they took the message of Islam to the entire world. ☰

                <p>
                    Law is an application of social design and government is the theoretical evolution of The Law of Allah. The Law of Allah comes through Thee, ordained messengers and the books that were granted as guidance. These books primarily include, The Quran, The Torah, and The Gospel. The Messengers include the few we are made aware of by The Books and many we are not.
                </p> 
            
                <p>
                    We, The Gillespie Hakeem Sovereign Providence (The GHSP), are a sovereign State of Affairs in The United American Intellectual Republic (The UAIR), and have presumed responsibility for our actions as independent national observers of these United States Governance. We have chosen to do so from our own theoretical supposition of halal law derived from our understanding of Quran and our needs as human beings born and raised in the deception of legal justice substituted for our natural human benefits. The US law as accurately described as; the law of inequality and injustice known as  these United States of theoretical code and government.
                </p> 
            
                <p>
                    As thus, we have arrived at the authority to declare; the code of The U.S. is not based on The Books or The Messengers of Allah; and is therefor derogatory to our benefits and beliefs as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah. As thus, we have chosen to keep our own record of DEED’s, ACTionS, FACT’s and BOND’s, and by Executive Vicegerent, authorize them to constitute our administration of contracts, liability, and remedy to the effect of halal governance. ☰
